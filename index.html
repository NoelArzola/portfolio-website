                        <h4>Mobile first HTML 5 &amp; CSS from Photoshop Design Comps</h4>
                        <p>This was created from the ground up from a set of three design comps for mobile, tablet, and desktop. It is a completely responsive multi-page website made using Flexbox with perfectly scaling images and text. Using Photoshop I pulled measurements, font-sizes, and line-heights to create an exact replica for all three experiences. This and my personal site are my favorite pieces of work.</p>

                        <p>This is a multi-page site made from scratch for a fictional food truck company. Using the Photoshop Design Comp I pulled the images, dimensions, and font styles. Using all of that data I created a base in HTML and then created the site and designed it to match the design in CSS.</p>

                        <h4>HTML 5 &amp; CSS from Photoshop Design Comp</h4>
                        <p>This is a project site that was converted from static to responsive. It was good practice taking an already established project and scaling it down for smaller screens and a better user experience. The amount of work that went into this really emphasized why mobile first development is so important and time-saving!</p>

                        <p>This is a Skillcrush project of a personal website   for a fictional developer also made from a PDC with the HTML and CSS coded from the ground up. It is a single page design that  contains a big, bold, beautiful header with work and contact sections that also stand out.</p>

                        <h4>HTML, CSS, &amp; JavaScript</h4>
                        <p>This is an interactive site fueled by JavaScript. At the top of the page it reflects the total votes and declares a winner. As you mouse over the states they will change from gray to the party color of the winner or blue if there is a draw. The table in the bottom corner will display the date, the candidates names, their total votes, and the winner of the state all following the same color scheme. I’ve always loved JavaScript and it was cool working with my first JavaScript framework.</p>

                        <p>The Magic 8 Ball you’ll find here puts my first 8 Ball to shame! The code is where the real beauty is at, it is so much more efficient, clean, and powerful. This interactive site displays an 8 Ball with an interactive button below it. Once you hit the button the ball will shake and you’ll be prompted to enter a question (choose wisely!). After one more shake the answer is revealed! You can find my first 8 Ball <span><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-magic-8-ball/5424639632965632">here</a></span> and my old coding and programming projects <span><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/kaid_1090753923038244403640020/projects">here</a></span>.</p>

                        <p>An interactive clock full of entertaining cat pics. There are four buttons that accept user input. Three are for setting a custom wake-up, lunch, and nap times which will trigger images related to each when the time matches. The fourth is a “PARTY TIME!” button that can be activated at any time, check out what happens when you tap it.</p>

                        <h3>Bruce Lee Manifesto</h3>
                        <h4>HTML & CSS Exercise</h4>
                        <p>While working on the Holstee Manifesto project I kept dreaming up this site in the back of my head. I don’t know if it’s because Bruce Lee and Holstee sound similar, or if it was the arrangement of inspirational quotes (probably both!). This was a crash course on cross-browser compatibility and required a lot of tweaking to get it just right on all major browsers. It was fun and rewarding. RIP the greatest of all time!</a></p>

                        <h4>HTML & CSS Exercise</h4>
                        <p>This was a fun project that involved Rubik’s cubing quotes from the Holstee Manifesto, divs, and padding into a work of art. It was the first project in my Skillcrush Break Into Tech course. It was a great exercise to practice CSS, measurements, padding, margin, and floats.</p>
